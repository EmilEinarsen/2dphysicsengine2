# What is this?
A second attempt/exploration into building a physics engine with HTML canvas (Canvas2D).
The next generation of [2dphysicsengine](https://github.com/EmilEinarsen/2dphysicsengine).

## Successes and Failures
Mainly succeeded with "comprehensive" collision detection, but had alot of issues with collision resolution (In particular "resolution correction").
